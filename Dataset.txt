FakeBERT: Fake news detection in social media with a BERT-based deep learning approach
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/s11042-020-10183-2 
 

Dataset Details 
• Dataset Name: 
    o Fake and Real News Dataset 
    o Gen-AI Misinformation Detection Dataset 
• Dataset File Type: CSV 
• No. of Samples: Approximately 45,000+ news articles (after sampling and preprocessing) 
• No. of Classes (Classification Problem): 2 classes (Fake, Real)

Motivation 
• The increasing use of AI tools has enabled the large-scale generation of fake news, making 
detection more challenging. 
• Existing fake news detection models lack robustness against AI-generated content and 
provide limited interpretability.


Objectives 
• To detect fake news written by both humans and AI systems using deep learning 
techniques. 
• To improve the existing FakeBERT model by integrating an attention mechanism. 
• To provide explainable predictions highlighting important words and phrases. 
• To compare multiple models and identify the most effective approach.



Technique 
• Text preprocessing and tokenization using NLP techniques. 
• Feature extraction using BERT embeddings. 
• Pattern learning using CNN and Bi-LSTM models. 
• Integration of an attention mechanism into FakeBERT. 
• Explainability using attention-based word importance visualization. 


Novelty 
• The attention-enhanced FakeBERT model improves detection accuracy for both human
written and AI-generated fake news by effectively focusing on important textual patterns. 
• The inclusion of explainability techniques enables transparent and interpretable 
predictions, making the system more reliable and trustworthy.
