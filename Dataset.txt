Dataset Details 
• Dataset Name: 
    o Fake and Real News Dataset 
    o Gen-AI Misinformation Detection Dataset 
• Dataset File Type: CSV 
• No. of Samples: Approximately 45,000+ news articles (after sampling and preprocessing) 
• No. of Classes (Classification Problem): 2 classes (Fake, Real)

Motivation 
• The increasing use of AI tools has enabled the large-scale generation of fake news, making 
detection more challenging. 
• Existing fake news detection models lack robustness against AI-generated content and 
provide limited interpretability.
